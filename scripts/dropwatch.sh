# # └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
# # Inspired by the 1970s SNL skit featuring Bill Murray:
# # “When you’ve got Spuds, you can put your mind on hold, do what you're told…”

# # This daemon watches for new memory drops and acts autonomously,
# # ideal for emotionally distressed states or total burnout.
# # You never have to think again. Just drop it, and it is done. 💀📥
